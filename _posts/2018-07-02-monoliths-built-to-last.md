title:  Monoliths Built to Last

Here’s a fun fact about my career: in almost a decade of working in Ruby, I’ve never been paid to write `rails new` into a console.

At Groupon and Braintree I’ve helped build some of the largest and longest-lived Rails monoliths in the world. As such, I’m sometimes asked for advice on writing Rails code that lasts.

Someday I’ll write more on this subject. For now my definitive answer is my last talk at Ancient City Ruby, “Ancient Rails”

I’d also be remiss if I didn’t link to [this excellent series on the topic from Braintree’s original CTO, Dan Manges](https://medium.com/@dan_manges/the-modular-monolith-rails-architecture-fb1023826fc4), who had a major role in many of the things we got right.
